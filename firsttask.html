  <h2> Causes</h2><hr>
  <h3>Productivity shock</h3>
       <p>It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the [productivity, output and
          employment] trends we are describing are long-time trends and were
		  thoroughly evident before 1929. These trends are in nowise the result
		  of the present depression, not are they the result of the World War.  On
		  the contrary, the present depression is a collapse resulting from these
		  long-term trends.</p>  
	  <p><strong>-M. King Hubbert</strong></p> 
  <p>The first three decades of the 20th century saw economic output surge with electrification, mass production, and motorized farm machinery, and because of the
  rapid growth in productivity there was a lot of excess production capacity and the
  work week was being reduced.</p>
